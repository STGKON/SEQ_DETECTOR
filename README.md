 #Prokaryotic SEQUENCE  Detector

This is a  program reads nucleotide sequences from standard input and checks
whether they contain a valid prokaryotic coding sequence (ORF).

## Conditions checked
- The sequence contains only valid nucleotides (A, T, G, C)
- The length of the sequence is a multiple of 3
- The sequence contains a start codon (ATG)
- The sequence ends with a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA)
- No stop codon appears before the final stop codon

## Output messages
- INVALID SEQ
- WRONG SIZE ODF SEQ
- ERROR REFERRED TO STOP CODON
- THERE IS A CORRECT SEQ
- NO
